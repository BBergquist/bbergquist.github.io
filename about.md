As you may have guessed by the title, I am a Software Engineer by trade, but I promise to keep the tech talk to a minimum. Work is only a small part of me, and that side of me has a plenty of time to express itself during the week; this blog will focus on the rest.

Outside of work... I am married to the lovely Sarah Bergquist. We like to ski together, (Sarah does it partially out of love for me, partially because I've managed to show her how much fun it can be), we both sing (thanks to her), and we have had the good fortune of traveling near and far in our few years together.

On my own, I like to ride and maintain my bike, practice writing/blog, and I am aspiring to do more DIY projects (watch out for posts).
